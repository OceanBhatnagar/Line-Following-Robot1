# Welcome to the Line Following Robot Project Repository!

This project is an implementation of a basic line-following robot using an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The robot is designed to follow a black line on a white surface using infrared (IR) sensors.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno Microcontroller
- L298N Motor Driver
- 2 IR Sensors
- 12V Rechargeable Battery
- 2 TT Gear Motors
- CAR CHASSIS With 2 Normal Wheels and 1 Castor Wheels

## Software
- **Arduino IDE**: Used for writing and uploading the code to the Arduino Uno.

## Project Structure
- **Code**: The Arduino code used to control the line-following robot.
- **Project Photographs**: Images of the assembled robot.
- **TinkerCAD Diagram**: A visual representation of the circuit in TinkerCAD.
- **Schematics**: Detailed schematics of the circuit.
